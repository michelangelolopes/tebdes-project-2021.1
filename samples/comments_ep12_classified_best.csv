for real though he's not even cared eren personally but the way he supported him so bad while having his own goal is just what a helpful selfless sidekick;irrelevant

ok first of all i never write any thing against aot animation so far because i konw how tiring it is but that doesn't mean i didnt notice any still frames or cgi stuff like that i was just trying to ignore it and kept enjoying yhe show but my fu king this episode this episode had such a big chance to gain the spotlight back again which was left somewhere in previous 3 episodes but noo mappa can never allow us to keep us to do so i mean im not being a nit picker or something like that but it 100 seems like mappa is trying to avoid every thing that has details and good animation potential to it because only speaking for this episode only first and the most biggest disappointment was that eren jacket scene it was too op in its original manga and pv version but the way he puts the jaket seems like he his wearing it for the fitst time in his life because who in the world bends that much to wear it and where the hell is the amazing background in tgat scene drom pv manga like its too much beyond ignorance capacity for me in this episode they even animated mikasa running towards armin in the biggening of the episode so much trash that you can literally see frame droops easily and then tgey skkiped erens crystal structure that he makes to escape from prison and then zackerys dead body deatils and soo much that it looks like people in mappa dont want to draw thats above mideocer level and make even epic legendary moments around mideocer like really please im beggeing srory is epic bit dont ruin it soo much that we have to notice concept like lack of deatils and wierd direction errors every episode pleass its a humble request;terrible
mappa and the entire aot staff are absolute clowns lmao it s so sad i always ask myself about what could have been if wit were the ones rather animating season 4 am just sick and tired of how they keep ruining all the hype moments how tf did they manage to ruin the jacket scene wtf wit always delivered when it mattered am yet to see mappa do justice to even one of the hype scenes indeed aot has massively lost its touch;terrible
you do realize that they are just rearranging scenes like they did with the pst episodes;irrelevant
mom said it's my turn to play on the xbox;irrelevant
guys there's no point in arguing with people who don't even have valid points to bring up especially those who haven't even watched the episode lol;irrelevant
wow this episode was good zackly went kaboom rip shit machine eren escapes out of prison that jacket scene could have been better but eren still looks hot as hell rise of the yeagerists here we go ooh the next episode is the restaurant scene no zeke this episode bummer;good
i liked this episode i think the episode was paced well and did a good job of building up tension no zeke this episode but it's coming soon;good
oh the things viewing with rose tinted glasses can do to people;irrelevant
it will be pg 13 but the censorship will be way lesser than what nhk allows that's the reason a movie could be a bit of a better option like mugen no train rengoku's messed up eye thou;irrelevant
at this rate words like this is really as annoying as among us meme lol;irrelevant
very obvious it will be at the beginning of next episode mod edit modified quote of edited post;irrelevant

eren's jacket scene was hyped af loved it;good
you can always drop the series so you won't have to suffer and also we don't get to have you here every week;irrelevant
still weightless thoughts by the way;irrelevant
ruin lol it is different not sincerly bad your standards are clearly in the sky for aot;average
this is a hot take but the eren jacket scene is much much better in the anime than it was in the trailer now fite me;good
intense buildup from start to finish seems like the animation quality is dropping a tier though which is very concerning indeed but the story quality is still top notch and that's more than enough to make up for it i honestly think eren climbing up that rock and putting on that cloak was amazing i've been waiting for this since the first pv i'm definitely curious what the mid card info was about zackly san down just when mikasa was about to commit a mischievous act such are the uncertain times in snk world i suppose yelena and zeke obviously up to something and seeing hange pixus trying to decipher it is pretty darn cool to watch unfold as well a restaurant they say i'm ready edit how'd i forget about hitchie loved that convo b w her and armin lol annie still popular as ever;good
i don't know imo it was really dope scene eren looked hot af i liked it but yeah i understand why would some people be disappointed;good
oh you would be gravely mistaken;irrelevant
it's just another looks cool ngl moment it's about preferences some prefer manga and trailer some prefer anime but i'm good with those 3 mod edit modified quote of edited post;good
they look amazing also both of them got rid of that yee yee ass haircut;good
it could also be lack of time and drawing that detail part would take up too much time;irrelevant
eren's jacket scene was way better in the trailer to be honest well this is the start of yeagerists claiming power;good
facts mappa proved itself to be a shit studio and whoever working on this should be fired expeditiously;irrelevant
y all really complaining about the jacket scene and how it s mappa s fault for the animation mappa was only given like 6 8 months what y all expect jujutsu kaisen tier animation;average
me when the epic mikasa still frame running keragamming said its not that they can't draw it its the lack of time that is the problem i'm pretty sure you are aware that they were in a very tight schedule and its a miracle that they got it out in such a short time so criticising them like this is really unfair keragamming said its not that they can't draw it its the lack of time that is the problem i'm pretty sure you are aware that they were in a very tight schedule and its a miracle that they got it out in such a short time so criticising them like this is really unfair they should've delayed;irrelevant
no it s definitely a mistake if you remember chapters 130 and 132 lol yelena had never met manbun eren at that point she met with the gentle soul heading towards depression eren from 3 years before big difference on mental state from both versions of eren;bad
off model drawings were many but i know they are gonna be fixed in the br direction was good but the preview of the next episode looks so much better than this;good
who care i don't even properly read you comment mod edit modified quote of edited post;irrelevant
can u please tell me what blu ray actually is and how to get it;irrelevant
all hail gigachad eren and god emperor floch dedicate your heart;irrelevant
was the manga also of the same pace;irrelevant
here is your jacket scene you crybabies;irrelevant
huh the fact that you are actually a manga reader but dont understand why showing the wrong version of eren speaking with yelena is an issue in terms of timeframe is concerning especially because this timeframe is referred to again later in the story and yes the hairstyle he has is actually important in this case;irrelevant
but it has an actual meaning in the grand scheme of things yes its a nitpick but it still is something they should've done right especially since the following sentence pixis confirms this yelena eren meeting happened before the attack on liberio where it was hobo eren at that point of the story;irrelevant
tfw the olympics is delayed but still have to train;irrelevant
we saw it in the preview for ep13 we are definitely getting it;irrelevant
mappa is caught up to the armin wank chapters although i disagree this looks better than in the manga but worse than the trailer but then again the jacket scene never really meant that much to me;average
ok guys it s time to bully mappa directors again at this point they re just begging for it lmao;irrelevant
abs deeper than the character writing;irrelevant
very good episode hitch has changed a lot finally that beautiful scene of ereh 0 0 and that final scene hmmmm next episode is going to be intresting;hyped
nearly 1 4 chapters adapted pacing was on top awesome episode;good
damn lots of off model character designs this episode sadge;disappointed
i think its more of a problem of drawing the details than censorship this time;bad
what i ve enjoyed the most of past slower episodes is that they do not cut much content at all from the manga there s so many important dialogues that completely removing some of it for a faster pacing would be detrimental this episode was good covered chapter 110 and some of 111 next episodes is definitely going to energize the masses to be honest my only complaint and call it a nitpick if you want is the jacket scene the overall character design of eren was really clean same for floch but when he puts his jacket on he looks like a hunchback the lighting is better than in the trailer but the shot itself is worse and i think its due to the slow mo animation i m only bringing it up because the panel itself from the manga gives me an eyegasm everytime i think they should ve used a still for it vs vs tatakae yeagerists;good
mappa spending all their money on jujutsu kaisen the animation is kind of bad;bad
can't they just take it from the trailer;disappointed
this one man damn looks so cool these duo looks determined as hell also there's another shots which is easily my fav from this episode entire season too perhaps;hyped
y all really complaining about the jacket scene and how it s mappa s fault for the animation mappa was only given like 6 8 months what y all expect jujutsu kaisen tier animation;average
i love the jacket scene it has its impact similar to the manga overall good episode;good
is it me or is aot's pace slowing down every episode;irrelevant
it was awesome and i liked the way floch spoke to him and the landscape colors etc awesome episode tho i wanted to see zachary non censored;good
from all the major anime sites this ofc would be the one to talk about a character wearing a shirt it's a pathetic place for people to discuss plot story possibilities etc horrible place;irrelevant
if you are anime only you are going to disappoint of not having action scenes if you are manga reader you cry about animation but believe me next episode is going to insane by the way levi looks great as hell;average
so eren has gone full rogue along with a bunch of followers and they assassinated the top commander eren also seems to have the people on his side against the military though imagine if armin and mikasa had been caught in that explosion how would eren have reacted;irrelevant
yeah lmao just hoping it doesn't get worse in the upcoming episodes preview at least looks a lil bit better;bad
unfortunately money talks and jjk is selling like hot cakes at the moment mod edit removed baiting;irrelevant
noooo zackly noooo the best inventor of aot universe finally the famous eren and his jacket scene though he looked kinda cooler in the trailer still looks good tho xd;good
this is going to get complicated very good episode;good
off model close up drawings will be corrected in the bluray version for sure though but ye pixis looks like an alien on some of those drawings lol;bad
1 from me i feel like people take this far too seriously it's crazy how critical people are being of mappa in these threads to point out every little thing for the episode itself it was pretty good in the past eren was a lot simpler to understand he was reckless but i could understand and get behind his reasoning but fast forward to today he's almost a completely different guy i don't understand what he's trying to do they are being far too vague about his reasons what got into to him to be so extreme and dare i say apathetic about things i never would've expected that he'd greenlight a plan to murder zack assuming he really did do it not to mention when he knows people that he cared about could be in the vicinity i'm not asking for spoilers if they give me more background in the future that's good enough what's piek doing in paradis;good
nice fucking animation is that what i'm supposed to fucking say;average
why are there so many people hating the episode is it because of the jacket scene;good
they did that eren jacket scene perfect;perfect
probably re arranged next ep i just hope it won't be as rushed as reiner's lol mod edit modified quote of edited post;average
it looks so bad in motion holy shit eren moves like a robot again the trailer was a scam everything looked better there;bad
floch is the best sidekick any protagonist has ever had;irrelevant
armin loves annie nice to see hitch again rip zackly yelena very sus eren jacket scene is better in the pre animated trailer animation quality overall of this episode is so average pieck best girl sighting in the end next episode is my favorite dealing with social darwinism;average
i'm surprised they censored zackly's corpse that much;irrelevant
no home no home i forgot xd;irrelevant
jesus i think my time here is done i thought the episode was great things are ramping up and i can't wait to see what happens next r i p zachary i mean again yes not every single shot was great that shot of mikasa's running was pretty awkward and sometimes pyxis looks a bit odd but to say that it's horrible and mappa are ruining the story nonsense;good
well this has better story telling so idc;good
seems enough i guess atleast its coloring is kind of annoys me there's plenty of em but im too lazy to take a screenshot for example like this episode that jacket scene is cool but the sunlight really bothering my eyes to focus on that sexy 10 pack abs;irrelevant
oh shit chad eren is back in action though it's a shame he's probs gonna be sidelined for a little bit longer based on the previews seems like next ep is gonna focus on monke and gabi falco though ngl i feel like the eren jacket sunset scene would've actually been a dope spot to leave the episode on lol;disappointed
if s4p2 is on late 2021 100 eren kino paths will be fucking ruined atleast armin and gabi fanboys can rest assured they'll get the highest wank and quality in both mediums;disappointed
ohhhhh shiitttt is it really;irrelevant
the jacket scene was weird tbh;bad
i can feel the pressure boiling and boiling this episode just brought it to the breaking point now that the supreme comander is dead and eren is free there is so much uncertenty on what will happen add onto that gabi falco going to the restaurant where the scouts are visiting and the marley warriors infiltrating paradis holy shit these final 4 episodes will be fire;hyped
rip zackly he went out with a bang the ost that played at the end of the episode was hype af;hyped
goes to show how hell the production schedule is easy blu ray fix;bad
i don't think the hairstyle he has matters to be honest i think it was a choice rather than a mistake we don't know if this was the first time eren wore a manbun;irrelevant
oh no the animation was trash even tho animators are crunching for hours and hours i swear someone in this thread said the staff of aot are clowns;irrelevant
bro shut up no one cares that they increased the length of eren's hair in one insignificant scene;irrelevant
same hopefully rearranged for next episode and they reveal it before niccolo tries to hit gabi with the wine bottle mod edit modified quote of edited post;irrelevant
go fight yourself i am busy right now;irrelevant
we lost a great artist and his masterpiece today rip zackley and the s h i t m a c h i n e gone too soon but never forgotten in his honour i would now like to remember the shit machine in its full uncensored manga glory nsfm rest in peace sweet prince mod edit added spoiler tags please hide plot details also added proper nsfm tags to the nsfm picture;irrelevant
rip zackly armin and mikasa were almost caught in the explosion i totally forgot about eren's jacket scene the trailer version looked better tho never liked floch;disappointed
when i learned that they didn't play youseebiggirl when eren wearing his jacket i was so disappointed;disappointed
the jacket scene was better in the trailer but still good overall an average episode;average
how was the pacing did they cut anything;irrelevant
dude eren looks massive jesus in the manga he is toned but here he is massive xd chad;irrelevant
you cherry pick frames and generalize your entire opinion over it everyone can do the same for aot under wit tiresome arguments that arent worth entertaining ipfdomain said sad7727 said animating a titan is too hard guys its literally impossible in this decade despite wit doing just fine 3 seasons animating new survery corps outfit is too hard and complex animating a guy in a sink too hard guys will be fixed in blu ray maybe animating a jacket is too hard guys maybe if everything is so hard on aot why would they take on the job facts mappa proved itself to be a shit studio and whoever working on this should be fired expeditiously you cant be a grown person with that mindset i refuse to believe so;irrelevant
great to see the dramatic ass meeting of eren and floch in motion eren's 10 pack oof hilarious seeing everyone crunch their teeth at the thought of submitting to the jaegerists can't wait for next episode's restaurant scene;hyped
animating a titan is too hard guys its literally impossible in this decade despite wit doing just fine 3 seasons animating new survery corps outfit is too hard and complex animating a guy in a sink too hard guys will be fixed in blu ray maybe animating a jacket is too hard guys maybe if everything is so hard on aot why would they take on the job;irrelevant
great episode because of the god tier source material the ost was also great but yeah the animation was so so;good
i know that that's not what i'm saying what i'm saying is it's not a mistake because it doesn't matter it is completely irrelevant what kind of hairstyle eren had when he met yelena also they could have changed it to take place more recently than when he had shorter hair we don't know if eren only wore a manbun starting with ch106 he could have worn it before even going to marley but we just didn't see it hayashi storyboarded this so i find it hard to believe he didn't do this intentionally;irrelevant
weakest episode so far in this season production is struggling and finally it's visible surprised anyway good episode content wise but something is missing like the feeling of something big is gonna happen soon i liked the ost played in jacket scene wish it looked clean i'm waiting for the best version to watch later;average
finnaly chad yeager and whats wrong with pixis's face i need to see again with 1080p;irrelevant
do you think they would show an exploded corpse cut off near his waist on television without censorship think they did the next best thing they could given their constraints;irrelevant
m not gonna buy it ofc i'll just have to pirate it like always after all it's aot we're talking about i would like to see it as better as i can;irrelevant
so if eren is supposed to be the villain now why is the show portraying him as being really cool and badass;irrelevant
i mean yeah they showed mike getting biten like a bubblegum to a certain extend or hannes having his guts hanging but they only showed 1 4 of zacharis head like come on;irrelevant
tell that to the production committee if they get enough time for part 2 things could be a lot better;irrelevant
it's about to be aot civil war out here hyping for the next battle great episode;hyped
do you know the difference between art and animation doesnt seem like it;irrelevant
armin caught lacking in 4k zackely got blown away eren escaped the abs scene woo hoo eren is a big ass fucking threat like he has never been before this episode sure did feel slow but good nonetheless the restaurant warrior candidates are going to get caught pieck has infiltrated already nice set up episode;good
he is finally here btw are they going to skip the zeke gas backstory cause it's too sensitive or will it be the next episode they also censored the shit out of zackly but oh well mod edit added spoiler tags please hide plot details;hyped
oh man when eren puts on that jacket like a badass similar to one of the promotional visuals looks like this episode is the beginning of the main climax for its buildup next month's episodes should be very exciting tbh;good
yeah go and tell kondasha committee they might change xd btw did you notice that stuff happened today oh wait story is irrelevant lmao;irrelevant
they left the ragako incident and adapted everything from 110 up to the restaurant part in 111 that ragako village incident will be included in episode 13 or 14 so it was like 1 3 chapters maybe but my concern is chapter episode 13 it needs to cover what was left from chapter 110 like 7 panels half of 111 and how much of 112 unless they leave the table scene for episode 14 which includes also levi that means that probably you gonna need chapter 114 115 and 116 adapted on episode 15 and 16 i hope they dont cut much mod edit added spoiler tags please hide plot details;irrelevant
damn too much crazy shit went down in this episode for me to compile it all here so all i'm going to speculate is if pieck is going to do to paradis what eren did to marley is it going to be another new cycle of wrongings at revenge similar to reiner and his squad invading paradis with titans and then eren and his squad invading eldia with theirs;irrelevant
that s some manga readers for you d;irrelevant
i cannot for the love me know why they didn't use the fucking trailer shot its already made just reuse it why reanimate eren to be 80 year old with back issues and fat ass cheeks with the sun being 2 cm from him do they seriously think it was better jesus christ;disappointed
really disappointing episode animation wise can not wait for the forest disaster now;disappointed
mappa confirming the theory;irrelevant
yea so blame kodansha and mappa higher ups not those poor animators crunching for hours;irrelevant
okay so a lot of shit went down the eren jacket scene was dope asf i wonder what he will do and was he responsible for that commander getting killed;irrelevant
fuck jjk mappa you should give more time to this masterpiece not some random generic shonen;disappointed
pacing got through so much and i'm pretty sure quite a bit was rearranged different kind of thrill but a thrill nonetheless surprised they skipped how eren broke out tho it wouldn't even be 10 seconds lol;disappointed
they need you man go and apply as a cad or animator btw did you notice that zachary blew up probably not since the story is not the main thing in this animation experts site xd;irrelevant
pieck chan what the fuck are you doing in paradis;irrelevant
tell me he succeeds;irrelevant
hitch has finally appeared in the final season it was funny when she noticed armin trying to touch the crystal with annie inside the scene with angry mob shouting shinzou sasageyo right after zachary died in an explosion was adapted perfectly i had imagined this scene to look like that while reading the manga same goes with awesome looking scene with eren putting on a jacket and same goes with the scene during which pixis and others were discussing the current situation on paradis including zachary's assassination by yaegerists the tension rises with each episode paradis is on the verge of civil war we are slowly getting closer to the ultimate climax of this situation pieck chan looked cute in the last frames of this episode by the way have you noticed two scenes with weird looking mikasa when she went with armin to zachary and pixis when he talked to mrs azumabito their faces looked weird not as bad as just weird lol;perfect
ey we finally agree on something also they don't love armin they love gabi;irrelevant
fucking blur that landscape was so beautiful if it wasn't for that goddamn blur i could barely see anything bunch of nobodies teamed up to work on the most popular anime ofc they cant do anything properly;average
every fucking eren kino scene is ruined except ep 5 i guess mappa really loves armin i guess;bad
i have no compassion for those who plot against eren they could die for all i care fuck you zachary the jacket scene is here actually it looks worse than it did in the manga even the trailer looked better but as we know that the trailer was a big fat lie i was waiting for the jacket scene for a long time kind of disappointed but i'll forgive mappa this time because of how many godly 10 pack eren shots they decided to add in this episode by far the best episode carried by eren's abs some more eren shots;disappointed
omggg u get it time to share;irrelevant
oh i forgot the other nitpick that i have is that mappa actually showed the wrong version of eren that talked with yelena about the plan it was in the past when eren had medium length hair to the sides but they showed manbun eren which yelena had never met and his facial expression was nonexistent fingers crossed that it s corrected in the blueray but low hopes for it happening anime manga;bad
all i can say is read the manga they even fucked up eren's hair in the yelena flashback eren was supposed to have short hair i have no idea what mappa is doing;bad
the only thing that matters;irrelevant
i am losing my passion because of this fucking adaption sigh wth is wrong with them no it is not time problem it is just that they don't know what the fans want and what this story need why would you let someone talented like omine direct ep11 which is not really as important as this one and butcher this ep don't they know that eren scene is really awaited by fans why would you make some random unimportant scenes look better i wish they will stop i prefer not getting an adaption for 3 years over killing my passion like this everytime i say wow next ep there will be that scene there is noway they will ruin it it is important and then they fucking ruin it they have a problem with important scene remember that mikasa enterance scene in ep6 that people hyped like mads then you got cg mikasa and ghoul face mikasa eren mirror scene and now this scene and many more i hate it i hate that this season existed it is disappointini wish i can ignore it and stop watching it but i can't;disappointed
shinzou sasageyo shinzou sasageyo shinzou sasageyo besides some off model shots this was a real good episode eren walked like a damn king looked way better than the pv imo pieck san in the end sasuga pieck chan as beautiful as ever the soundtrack there was also hyped af i was shitting myself the whole episode;hyped
no because trailer shot is different eren model and also it's just colored manga panel with no animation;irrelevant
zeke and yelena's plan is in motion;irrelevant
what's wrong with pixis face it really needs to be completely redone in the bluray idk what is the problem with the jacket scene it looks really great i really don't know what people are complaining about;good
i guess that's the main reason people can't change their profile picture to the one they desired it to be;irrelevant
any manbun eren content is good even if it's not supposed to be like that;good
i can't get over these guys crying over a jacket wearing scene that doesn't look bad at all btw it's just too cringe it's just a guy wearing a jacket chill;average
the animation is not bad still some people complained about it small small not die big big trouble people these people always complain then compare to jjk so stupid haiyaaa overall good episode and good animation;good
the animation was possibly the most limited in this ep out of the 12 we have nothing to cry about tho i saw eren's nipple;average
great episode drawings didnt seem off model at all idk what people are seeing and are nitpicky about i mean mappa is delivering decent quality chad eren scene was well dpne although a little bit of off model in betweening considering it was an imp scene couldve been done better but still great episode good choice of ost;average
ok so let me complaint first a lot of eye sore animation and i didn't like jacket scene and m the guy who didn't even watched the trailer so i don't get spoiled even a little bit honestly jacket scene could've been much better but eren is so badass and when he said locate zeke it made my heart skip a beat so i would say it made up for it and pacing was ok in my opinion armin and annie was amazing and ofc hitch was being a hitch especially i would love to see mikasa being more than soldier and having a greater power or influence at her disposal like hizuru's whole nation overall amazing ep;good
just watched the episode with rock bottom expectations and it was fine for the most part aside from some off model faces that can easily be fixed later on eren coat scene was paced oddly but it was far from terrible it was good enough not as epic as it could have been but it's not like the anime is ruined pacing was really good;average
if they're incapable of drawing a still frame then what can they draw;irrelevant
i mean i do get that the jacket scene is iconic but is it really that important;irrelevant
yes yes i agree as long as we see eren not everyone is a manga reader so we don't care about that kind of detail;irrelevant
oh shit yeah that seems too big of a mistake to happen could it be intentional if so i wonder why maybe fanservice lol;bad
i'm done that fcking jacket scene was so awful;terrible
damn that explosion rip zackly it could have killed armin and mikasa too the situation is extremely tense and eren walking outside shirtless was epic what a chad;good
now i definitely want the next parts to be in a movie format or else they'll censor everything;irrelevant
lol what you acting like the manga doe3sn't exist its also of quality;irrelevant
who are you saying that to mappa or the staff of aot and they are incapable of drawing a still frame u expect them to give sakuga everytime in a rushed schedule;irrelevant
eren did nothing wrong and everyone need a follower like floch;irrelevant
god that eren jacket scene was such a cocktease in the trailer and no surprise there they changed it and made it worse decent episode nonetheless;average
the buildup to something big i love it what is up with the complaining though people out here nitpicking every little thing;good
personally think that was an animation mistake according to the story yelena met up with eren close to the time with the train blushing scene and eren's hair still hadn't grown enough for a manbun at this point something they can fix in the blueray and seems minor but it shouldn't affect the story much as you said;irrelevant
lmfao this cannot be real;irrelevant
thank christ it got good again despite that previous shitty episode based on what i've seen so far in this season the new eldian military was so greedy and desperate to cling to whatever perceived semblance of power they had that they decided to lock their greatest asset up and then attempt to kill him despite popular opposition from the people and as a result left him with literally no option but to turn against them with the forward thinking members of the military following suit eren's faction tried reasoning with them got locked up for revealing what was going on to the people they tried peaceful protests which were completely ignored they are living in a military dictatorship so it's not like they had any means to try and vote zackley out add to that the urgency of the military deciding to have eren executed and what the fuck did you expect coup completely justified yeagerist faction all the way only thing i wish is that mikasa was right there with him instead of these weird shocked faces when she knows these fucks were literally about to kill him remember season 1 when eren first transformed into a titan and those military guys were trying to kill him so she pulled her blades out and threatened to slice up anybody who approached them or season 2 when eren got kidnapped and she threatened to kill both ymir and historia if they got in her way how is this different pretty sure she'll side with him eventually but this hesitation is weird anyway floch is such a commendable character now the mikasa fangirl from previous episode was right next to him too very interested in seeing more of them somewhat surprised with how quickly eren went along with this new faction which suggests to me he was in on it from the start lastly we got a shot of pieck who seems to have snuck onto paradis i guess marley has indeed moved quickly and not just to launch a straight forward invasion should get even more interesting with effectively 3 factions clashing now overall very satisfied with this week's episode;good
that's not a simple decision the world of making anime is a obscure world many people think that its simple but its not;irrelevant
the jacket scene was something i was looking forward to the most this season but i am very disappointed with how it looked;disappointed
you can never make people happy it seems that all the fanboys who picked up the manga in the last year or two and think of themselves as experts are nitpicking every single thing out that mappa does no adaptation is perfect the animation was less impressive as is the usual for more dialogue centric chapters lighten up edit the threads are blowing up with one stupid discussion after another mods should really limit who can start a new discussion thread in a popular show like this one;irrelevant
i hate mappa and you should to for the better future i got fever after hearing that they ruined eren jacket scene mod edit modified quote of edited post;disappointed

eren escapes prison and we finaly see the glorious eren moment in the anime that jacket scene was cool but the one in the trailer was better well everyone's out to catch eren now also connie's getting more and more annoying he's just too salty atm and can't get a clear view of things pieck is shown at the end so they've already infiltrated paradis;good
animation kind of subpar in this one imo but whole eren scene was good maybe i m just a sucker for scenes with the sunset in the background although i am going to say i prefer trailer version;average
it was different from the world i saw in a r m i n ' s b o o k the trailer;irrelevant
you should see the attack on titan wiki discord during and after the episode airs if you think this is bad place is a cesspit in fact i wouldn't be surprised if a lot of negativity you see on here comes from same users over there;irrelevant
i sometimes think that we don't deserve the final season to be animated because of these reviews for god sake guys why we can't enjoy the show without being an experts in criticising people who worked their ass off on this project and still suffering i don't think we can do better than what they delivered there's nothing wrong with this season we just need to forget wit studio and forget that we have had watched the trailer;average

floch you absolute chad you madlad;irrelevant
both of those were season 2 right think aot was on mbs at that point and not nhk like right now censorship constraints may differ due to the channel change and nhk is one of the main broadcasters in japan iirc i totally understand you though i would have preferred it not to be censored but given the channel constraints they did what they could;irrelevant
hell of a scheduled because of production committee people wanting the best quality there some off model characters but that's all for me the eren jacket scene is way better in the anime than the manga;good
hell nah lmao i couldn't care less not like i watch the entirety of aot just to sit here and complain about animation its just so fucking disappointing man imagine new anime watchers watching this shit a year from now they will literally drop this shit lol;terrible
the ost in this episode was perfect i love how mappa animated the explosion scene nice to see my girl hitch again the pacing in this episode was also perfect imo next episode gonna be sooo good i ve been waiting so long to see the restaurant scene animated d also eren did the thing he did the coat thing ahhh it looked kinda weird tho;hyped
eren jacket wearing was great i really can not understand some people that scene was bad just because it did not look like the manga;good
so imo the eren jacket sence was better than the trailer one actually i don't get it why the hell they are complaining about slightest shit you just watched it online from japan that's not the actual quality just wait and watch 1080p from crunchyroll then post critisesm some actually didn't watch it the episode yet idk man i'm sick of this toxicity it just ruining my experience and some other people;irrelevant
there was some little problems with animation but overall it was good i think you guys are complaining so much;good
mappa haters can keep on hating they did a great job animating this episode if it weren't for them we wouldn't be watching aot finale season right now;good
it was a very nice episode as usual the eren scene was made actually better than the trailer so props to mappa for that also pieck chan at the end aaaaahhhhh that was so hype 3 5 5;hyped
i have a mixed feeling but overall it's 4 7 5 the design isnt showing inconsistencies but straight changing it from what we've seen in previous episodes of s4 but hange floch and eren seems upgraded to the same level as gabi so it's cool for me thanks god this episode met its purpose to be tenseful it surely is from start to finish my reaction is what the fuck is happening what's impressive about this one is military reactions and civilians shinzou wo sasageyo it seems their coup d'etat from s3 backlash on them lol by the way claps to pixis he's the mvp of this episode him cornering yelena him taking a lead of militaries and his charisma is just hell fucking chad on the side note looks like they want to show that yeagerist as kind as possible glorify them we got calmer eren and floch which is funny because both of them originally loud as fuck some dedicated looks from another members of yeagerist and civilians supports also why the fuck onyankopon is so cool and likeable as hell;good
awesome episode chadren the great looked really good jacket scene was good some off model drawings but they will probably be fixed in the blu ray hopefully the zackly death censorship is also fixed in the blu ray animation quality is dropping a bit but that's understandable and it still looks great can't wait for next weeks episode;good
blu ray is improved verisons of the anime it released 3 6 months after the anime ends you either buy it for 300 or get it for free on some websites however if they'll improve much or not is up to debate in dorohedoro they barely changed anything and since this is 8 eps per blu ray i doubt there will be massive changes maybe recolor or a panel there and there 99 99 will look the same;irrelevant
its not that they can't draw it its the lack of time that is the problem i'm pretty sure you are aware that they were in a very tight schedule and its a miracle that they got it out in such a short time so criticising them like this is really unfair;irrelevant
so true but you still want sick animation to go with such great stories just like the previous season to make it a masterpiece;average
one piece tier tbh lmao;perfect
the episode was fine and all but they completely butchered the eren wearing the jacket scene the one in the trailer was way better;disappointed
dudes complaining about how someone puts on a jacket now lmfao honestly though i feel like after ep 7 or 8 some of the animation parts look off i guess i think the backgrounds and still frames of some shots are really good but its occasionally looks kind of strange at times hope they're just saving it for later scenes lol;good
